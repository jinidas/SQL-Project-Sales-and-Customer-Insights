# SQL-Project-Sales-and-Customer-Insights
This SQL project successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database for sales and customer insights. By structuring data across multiple interconnected tables—Customers, Products, Employees, Orders, and OrderDetails—we ensure data integrity, optimization, and efficient retrieval of business insights.

Through a variety of SQL queries, stored procedures, and analytical reports, we extracted valuable insights, such as top-selling products, high-value customers, employee performance, and inventory status. The use of randomized data generation (via RAND()) also made this project more dynamic, simulating a real-world sales environment.

This project not only strengthens SQL proficiency but also highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in business. Future enhancements can include stored procedures for automated reporting, triggers for stock management, and performance optimization techniques to handle large-scale data efficiently.
